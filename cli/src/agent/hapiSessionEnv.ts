/**
 * Publish the hub session id into `process.env` so every downstream agent spawn
 * inherits it. HAPI runs one hub session per CLI process (the runner forks a
 * fresh `hapi` child per session, and local invocations are 1:1), and every
 * flavor's agent spawn derives its child env from `process.env` — so setting it
 * here covers claude / codex / cursor / gemini / opencode / kimi / grok / pi at
 * once, including future flavors, without touching each launcher.
 *
 * Prefer the MCP `display_image` tool for inline media when it is available;
 * `HAPI_SESSION_ID` is the deterministic fallback for hub REST and shell tooling.
 * To read or message another session, prefer MCP `inspect_peer` / `ping_peer`
 * (or `hapi inspect-peer` / `hapi ping-peer`) - do not reinvent JWT+curl.
 *
 * For lazy Codex sessions the id must only be exported after the hub row is
 * materialized — exporting the provisional id early makes GET /api/sessions/:id
 * fail until materialize completes.
