// agy-carriers/ directory. A pid recorded by namespace A means nothing in
// namespace B — probing it there can hit ESRCH for a process that is very
// much alive in A.
//
// hostname alone (the original Fix N6) does not close this: two containers
// sharing a HAPI_HOME typically also share a hostname (or both default to
// the same short container-id-derived one), which is exactly the collision
// this guard exists to prevent. `scope` instead identifies the boot +
// PID-namespace pair a carrier's pid was recorded in on Linux (see
// computeLocalCarrierScope()) or the machine + boot-session pair on macOS
// (see computeLocalCarrierScopeAsync/warmCarrierScope) — which
// distinguishes exactly the cases hostname could not: two containers on the
// same host (different PID namespaces, same boot_id) and the same container
// across a restart (same PID namespace file, but the boot_id — read from
// the host's /proc — differs only across an actual host reboot, which is
// the one case where every previously-recorded pid is unconditionally dead;
// this fix does not attempt to special-case that, see sweepAgyHookCarriers's
// docstring). A platform/environment this module cannot identify at all (a
// restricted /proc that exists but denies these specific reads, a
// failed/timed-out macOS probe, Windows — see computeLocalCarrierScopeAsync's
// docstring for why it stays unsupported — or any other unrecognized
// process.platform) gets no scope and is therefore never swept — hostname
// is not an identity, so there is deliberately no

 *   - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager` has nothing

 *   - `Win32_OperatingSystem.LastBootUpTime` via CIM was measured at
 *     1.4-2.5s per call on real hardware (2026-08-07) — this is meant to be
 *     cheap identity plumbing, not a multi-second startup cost.
 *   - `net statistics workstation` / `systeminfo` output is locale-dependent
 *     (parsing failed against Korean-locale Windows output in testing) —

 * risk the over-delete above. Before re-enabling Windows, find a boot-scoped
 * (not machine-scoped) identifier cheaper than CIM; re-measure whatever the

/**
 * Removes agy hook carriers under HAPI_HOME whose owning process has been
 * ACTIVELY confirmed dead: owner.json is present and parses (pid + a
 * non-empty scope), that scope exactly matches this process's own
 * computeLocalCarrierScope(), AND process.kill(pid, 0) raises ESRCH for that
 * pid. Meant to be called once per session start — see runAgy.ts.
 *
 * Fix 2 (hardened from the original hostname-only Fix N6): two things used
 * to let this delete a carrier that was still very much in use.
 *
 *  (a) A carrier whose owner.json failed to read — for ANY reason, not just
 *      "genuinely never written" — used to be swept once it turned 24h old.
 *      But a transient read failure (a concurrent write racing the read, a
 *      momentarily-unmounted overlay, ...) against a live, multi-day agy
 *      session looks IDENTICAL to a genuinely ownerless leftover from this
 *      function's point of view — there is no way to tell them apart from
 *      here. Sweeping on age alone in that case can delete a carrier a
 *      running session still depends on for its permission bridge. There is
 *      no longer an age-based path at all: an unreadable/missing owner.json
 *      is now preserved unconditionally. The cost is that legacy
 *      (pre-this-fix) or truly-orphaned ownerless carriers never get swept
 *      automatically — every carrier created after this fix always has a
 *      readable owner.json, so this cost is one-time, not ongoing.
 *
 *  (b) hostname alone doesn't identify a PID namespace: two containers
 *      sharing a HAPI_HOME (bind mount, NFS home) commonly also share a
 *      hostname, so a pid recorded by one could be misread as belonging to
 *      the other's PID space and probed there. computeLocalCarrierScope's
 *      boot-id+PID-namespace scope (falling back to a distinctly-tagged
 *      hostname only where /proc isn't usable) closes this the same way a
 *      stronger identity always beats a weaker one: an exact match is
 *      required, not merely a matching hostname.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative in every ambiguous direction, in this priority
 * order: local scope cannot be determined at all -> preserve everything
 * (never scan for anything to delete); a carrier's owner cannot be read ->
 * preserve; a carrier's owner scope doesn't exactly match -> preserve; the
 * owner is alive (including EPERM — alive, just not ours) or liveness can't
 * be determined -> preserve. Only "read owner, scope matches, pid confirmed
 * dead" deletes. Over-deleting a carrier still in use silently kills that
 * session's permission bridge and discovery hook; over-preserving a truly
 * dead carrier just leaves inert bytes on disk under HAPI_HOME. The two
 * mistakes are not symmetric, so this only ever errs toward preservation.
 *
 * Best-effort and side-effect-free on failure: an unreadable carriers root,
 * or a single entry this process can't stat/read, is skipped rather than
 * thrown — a broken sweep must never abort session startup.

 * observe a partially-written file: JSON.parse throws, agy drops every hook
 * registered under this carrier for that read (including the PreToolUse
 * permission bridge, not just the PreInvocation discovery hook this function
 * is used to add/remove). Writing to a sibling temp file in the same
 * directory and renaming over the target avoids that window — rename() is
 * atomic on the same filesystem, so agy only ever observes the old complete

 *
 * Throws if the carrier's .agents directory does not exist; callers must
 * check agyHookCarrierIsIntact() first and fall back to
 * prepareAgyHookCarrier() (a fresh carrier) if it does not.
 *
 * Fix N5: the temp file must be a same-directory sibling of the target for
 * renameSync's atomicity to hold (see above) — it cannot simply be moved
 * outside .agents/ to satisfy writeOwnerMetadata's "no HAPI bookkeeping
 * inside .agents/" rule (that rule is about files agy's own directory scan
 * could stumble on; a same-fs rename target is a different constraint
 * entirely). So instead, a failed renameSync (or a throw from the caller's
 * own error handling further up the stack — this function is best-effort
 * per detachPreInvocationHook/syncPreInvocationHookForLaunch's fail-open
 * contract) must not leave the temp file behind: without cleanup, every
 * failed detach/re-attach cycle leaves one more `.hooks.json.<pid>.<uuid>.tmp`
